Documentation: Pushing a Project from VSCode to GitHub
Prerequisites
Ensure you have Git installed on your machine.
Have a GitHub account and a repository created where you want to push your project.
Steps to Push Your Project
1. Open Your Project in VSCode
Launch Visual Studio Code.
Open the folder containing your project by navigating to File > Open Folder.
2. Initialize Git (if not already done)
Open the terminal in VSCode by selecting View > Terminal.
Run the following command to initialize a Git repository:
bash
Run
Copy code
git init
3. Add Your Remote Repository
Set the remote repository URL to your GitHub repository. Use the following command:
bash
Run
Copy code
git remote add origin https://github.com/mdarman4002/Major-Project-College-NIET-.git
4. Stage Your Changes
Stage all your changes for commit by running:
bash
Run
Copy code
git add .
5. Commit Your Changes
Commit the staged changes with a descriptive message:
bash
Run
Copy code
git commit -m "Initial commit"
6. Check Your Current Branch
Check which branch you are currently on:
bash
Run
Copy code
git branch
If your branch is named master, you can push it directly. If itâ€™s named main, you will need to ensure you are on that branch.
7. Push Your Changes
If your branch is master, push it using:
bash
Run
Copy code
git push -u origin master
If you want to rename your branch to main, use:
bash
Run
Copy code
git branch -m main
git push -u origin main
8. Handling Errors
Error: Remote Origin Already Exists
If you encounter the error error: remote origin already exists, check your existing remotes:
bash
Run
Copy code
git remote -v
If the URL is incorrect, remove the existing remote and add the correct one:
bash
Run
Copy code
git remote remove origin
git remote add origin https://github.com/mdarman4002/Major-Project-College-NIET-.git
Error: src refspec main does not match any
If you see the error error: src refspec main does not match any, ensure you have made at least one commit. If your branch is named master, push it using:
bash
Run
Copy code
git push -u origin master
Error: Repository Not Found
If you encounter fatal: repository 'https://github.com/mdarman4002/Major-Project-College-NIET-/tree/main/InterviewMate/' not found, it indicates that the remote URL is incorrect. Remove the existing remote and add the correct URL:
bash
Run
Copy code
git remote remove origin
git remote add origin https://github.com/mdarman4002/Major-Project-College-NIET-.git
9. Verify the Push
After successfully pushing your changes, verify by visiting your GitHub repository at:
Run
Copy code
https://github.com/mdarman4002/Major-Project-College-NIET-
Conclusion
By following these steps, you should be able to successfully push your project from Visual Studio Code to GitHub. This documentation serves as a reference for future revisions and troubleshooting.
